<h2>Welcome</h2>
This is my first <i>basic</i> try at Vue.js.<br /><br />

It's just a <b>basic application</b> to help you study. I noticed that I could <b>compile my Vue script in node</b>, the same way I would with Angular but I thought this would be a better showcase, I mean this way I can how a <b>.htaccess</b> file example but still do some Vue.js testing!<br /><br />

I am a master of Google/reference guides and a <b>quick learner</b>, I can work these things out autonomously. I also <b>understand security and secure applications</b>. I'm also a Leader and never afraid of a challenge, <b>I love to mentor</b> and write code.<br /><br />

By the way, I'll probably turn this into a real app one day. It needs alot of work but please tell me what you think!<br /><br />

One last note, I haven't optimized this for Safari or mobile.. oops! You can see me doing this over at <a href="https://cameronmcguffie.com" target="_blank">cameronmcguffie.com</a>
